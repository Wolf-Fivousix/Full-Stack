## Questions:
1. Modal scrolling for New Server.
2. Create Server form "back" buttom giving a warning.
3. Entering server name and pressing "enter" goes back instead of creating new server. How do I select the default button that should be pressed?
4. How does the form know which button is the "Submit" button?
5. What factors would make a route through API?
6. Why is my Servers Errors returning a full object instead of just an array, like Session Errors?
7. How to add servers to the State when the user logs in.
8. Also, go through the server mess I made, check if it is proper.

## Current Known Bugs:
1. Guest Login setState for blanking out password works, but not for email field.
